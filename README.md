# sql_challenge

This assignment was completed without any assistance from classmates, tutors or asking BCS. My experience working with Access and then in 3 years in IT learning SQL helped me. I only had to refer to the documentation on particular areas of the script because I was a little familiar with T-SQL. I added an extra script to validate the number of rows of data before completing the actual task.  This was u nder Task#6:
--finding how many employees work in the Sales department
select count(*)
from dept_emp
Where dept_no = 'd007'

The way I formatted the scripts was based on formatting requirements from my previous limited experience working with a team using T-SQL. I found that this allowed an easier method to troubleshooting or easily reading scripts.  What I did learn was the creation of the ERD both with using an ERD diagram program and within Postresql. I also learned how to import data directly into tables from a .csv file.  

The file submitted includes the ERD diagram of the data base tables, the tables script and the query script
